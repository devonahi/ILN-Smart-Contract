# ILN Smart Contract

[![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-blue.svg)](LICENSE)

Soroban smart contracts for the **Invoice Liquidity Network (ILN)** — a two-sided protocol on [Stellar](https://stellar.org) that connects invoice holders (freelancers, SMEs) with liquidity providers (LPs). Contracts act as trustless escrow: funds are held on-chain, payment terms are enforced by code, and settlement follows a strict state machine.

## How it works

| Actor | Role |
|-------|------|
| **Freelancer** | Submits unpaid invoices and receives early liquidity |
| **Payer** | The client who owes the invoice; settles on-chain |
| **Liquidity provider (LP)** | Funds invoices at a discount; earns yield when the payer pays |
| **ILN contracts** | Hold escrow, enforce rules, emit events, and route token transfers |

Typical lifecycle:

1. Freelancer calls `submit_invoice` → invoice is **Pending**.
2. LP calls `fund_invoice` → freelancer receives `(amount − discount)`; invoice is **Funded**.
3. Payer calls `mark_paid` → LP receives principal + yield; invoice is **Paid** (terminal).

Alternative paths include partial funding, defaults, disputes, appeals, and governance-controlled parameter updates. See [Architecture](docs/Architecture.md) for diagrams and edge cases.

## Contracts

| Crate | Path | Responsibility |
|-------|------|----------------|
| **`invoice_liquidity`** | `contracts/invoice_liquidity/` | Core escrow: submit, fund, settle, cancel, and default invoices; reputation scores; multi-token support; optional payer oracle |
| **`iln_governance`** | `contracts/iln_governance/` | On-chain governance: proposals, voting, delegation, quorum, and admin veto |
| **`iln_distribution`** | `contracts/iln_distribution/` | Yield and incentive distribution for LPs, freelancers, and payers (linked to governance token) |
| **`reputation_bonus`** | `contracts/reputation_bonus/` | Reputation-based discount bonuses and related invoice hooks |
| **`iln_fuzz`** | `contracts/fuzz/` | Property-based fuzz tests against core invoice flows |
| **Integration tests** | `contracts/tests/` | Cross-contract tests with mock tokens and oracles |

All contracts compile to Soroban WASM (`wasm32v1-none`) and are tested natively via `soroban-sdk` test utilities (no live network required for `cargo test`).

## Architecture

High-level component view (one deployment per network; `invoice_liquidity` is the primary integration surface):

```

**Design notes**

- No backend server; state transitions are driven by signed on-chain invocations.
- Persistent storage uses Soroban `StorageKey` patterns (see [Storage Layout](docs/storage-layout.md)).
- Major design decisions are recorded as [ADRs](docs/adr/README.md).

## Quick start

### Prerequisites

| Tool | Version |
|------|---------|
| [Rust](https://rustup.rs/) | ≥ 1.74 |
| `wasm32v1-none` target | `rustup target add wasm32v1-none` |
| [Stellar CLI](https://developers.stellar.org/docs/tools/cli) | For deploy / invoke (optional for tests) |

### Clone, build, and test

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Invoice-Liquidity-Network/ILN-Smart-Contract.git
cd ILN-Smart-Contract

# Install WASM target (first time only)
rustup target add wasm32v1-none

# Build optimized WASM for all contracts
make build
# or: cargo build --target wasm32v1-none --release

# Run the full test suite
make test
# or: cargo test

# Run property-based fuzz tests
make fuzz
# or: cargo test -p iln_fuzz
```

### Local network (optional)

For integration testing against a local Stellar node:

```bash
./scripts/setup-local-env.sh   # Docker + CLI config
./scripts/deploy-local.sh      # Build & deploy all contracts
./scripts/local-test.sh        # Smoke tests against local node
```

See [Local Development Guide](docs/local-development.md) for troubleshooting and CI notes.

### Deploy to testnet

Full step-by-step instructions (fund accounts, upload WASM, deploy, initialize) are in [Developer Quickstart §7](docs/developer-quickstart.md#7-deploying-to-testnet). Quick deploy of all workspace contracts:

```bash
cargo build --target wasm32v1-none --release
./scripts/deploy-local.sh testnet alice
```
