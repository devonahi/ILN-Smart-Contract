//! Insurance pool interface (Issue #123).
//!
//! Defines the cross-contract surface for the default-protection insurance
//! pool. Liquidity providers (LPs) may *optionally* opt into the pool by paying
//! premiums; if an invoice they funded later defaults, the pool compensates
//! them out of the accumulated premium balance.
//!
//! This trait is intentionally minimal and design-forward. It is consumed by:
//!   * the [`InsurancePool`](crate::InsurancePool) stub contract in this crate,
//!     which provides a correct-but-simplified implementation, and
//!   * the main `invoice_liquidity` contract, which (in a follow-up) invokes
//!     [`claim`](InsurancePoolInterface::claim) from its default-handling path
//!     via the generated [`InsurancePoolClient`].
//!
//! The full risk/pricing model (premium curves, coverage caps, payout
//! priority) is deliberately out of scope here and tracked as a follow-up.
