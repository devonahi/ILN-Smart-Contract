# ADR-005: Governance Timelock Length (No Timelock in v1)

**Date:** 2024-05-01  
**Status:** Accepted

## Context

After a governance proposal passes (quorum met, majority in favour), there is a
window between the vote closing and the proposal being executed on-chain. A
**timelock** is a mandatory delay in that window that gives the community time
to react — exit positions, raise objections, or prepare for the change — before
it takes effect.

The ILN governance contract (`iln_governance`) executes proposals via
`execute_proposal`, which cross-contract-calls the ILN contract to apply the
change atomically. The team had to decide how long the timelock delay should be.

Competing concerns:

- **Security** — a longer delay gives more time to detect and respond to a
  malicious or erroneous proposal.
- **Agility** — a shorter delay lets the protocol respond quickly to market
  conditions (e.g. adjusting fee rates during a crisis).
- **Admin veto as substitute** — the governance contract already has an admin
  emergency veto (`veto_proposal`) that can block any `Active` or `Passed`
  proposal before execution. This provides a safety net that partially
  substitutes for a timelock during the early protocol phase.
- **Protocol maturity** — at launch, the governance token distribution is
  concentrated; a long timelock would slow down necessary parameter tuning
  without providing meaningful decentralisation benefits.

## Decision

**No timelock delay in v1.** `execute_proposal` is callable by anyone
immediately after the 3-day voting window closes, provided quorum and majority
criteria are met. The admin veto power serves as the emergency brake during the
early phase.

The `TimelockNotExpired` error code is reserved in the error enum for a future
timelock implementation.

A timelock **must be introduced before the admin veto power is disabled**
(which must happen before mainnet launch per the governance documentation).

## Alternatives Considered

| Alternative | Why rejected |
|-------------|--------------|
| **24-hour timelock** | Adds friction without meaningful security benefit while the admin veto exists; a 24-hour window is too short for large token holders to coordinate a response anyway. |
| **48-hour timelock** | Same reasoning as 24-hour; the admin veto already covers the early phase. |
| **7-day timelock (Compound-style)** | Appropriate for a mature, decentralised protocol, but excessive for a protocol in active parameter tuning. Would slow down legitimate fee adjustments. |
| **Configurable timelock (governance sets the delay)** | Correct long-term design, but adds implementation complexity at v1. Deferred to a future upgrade. |
| **Optimistic execution with challenge period** | Complex to implement correctly; requires a separate challenge mechanism and bond. Out of scope for v1. |

## Consequences

**Positive:**
- Proposals can be executed immediately after voting closes, enabling rapid
  response to protocol conditions.
- Implementation is simpler — no timelock storage, no expiry checks on
  execution.
- The admin veto provides equivalent protection during the early phase when
  token distribution is concentrated.

**Negative / Trade-offs:**
- Without a timelock, a proposal that passes cannot be stopped by the community
  once the admin veto is disabled. This is a significant risk for a mature,
  decentralised protocol.
- The absence of a timelock is a known deviation from DeFi governance best
  practices (MakerDAO, Compound, Uniswap all use timelocks of 2–7 days).
- **Action required:** A timelock must be implemented and activated via a
  governance upgrade before `disable_veto_power()` is called. Failure to do
  so leaves the protocol without any execution delay after full decentralisation.
- The `TimelockNotExpired` error is reserved but unimplemented; contributors
  must not assume it is enforced.
